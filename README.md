# csci401_quiz8

This repo contains a Turing Machine I designed for a quiz in NIU CSCI 401. The objective of the quiz was to create a TM that would accept all strings with more a's than b's over the alphabet {a,b}. In order to use the design I had come up with, I first had to prepend a # to the string or else the machine would not be able to read successfully as it would end up shifting left off the end of the tape.
